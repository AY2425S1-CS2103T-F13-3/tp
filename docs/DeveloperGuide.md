## **Design**

### Architecture

This architecture diagram gives a high-level overview of the app's design.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

**Architecture Components**

**`Main`** consists of [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ddd/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ddd/MainApp.java), and is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The app consists of the following components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): Renders user interface (UI) components of the app.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Exexcutes commands.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): In-memory representation of the app's data.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Stores data locally.
* [**`Commons`**](#common-classes): A collection of classes used by multiple components.

**Component Interactions**

This sequence diagram shows how the components interact with each other for a scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

With the exception of `Commons`, each component is structured as such:

* Component API is defined in an `interface` named `XYZ`, where XYZ is the name of the component.
* Implements its functionality using a concrete `XYZManager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

### UI Component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ddd/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `DisplayedListPanel` etc. Each UI component inherits from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ddd/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component:

* Takes user input and pass it to the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Depends on `Model` (specifically `Client`, `Vendor` and `Event`) since it render data from the items inside `Model`.

When a user executes a command, the results of their command will be rendered within a single `DisplayedListPanel`. `DisplayedListPanel` contains some number of `DisplayedCard`, which could either be a `ClientCard`, `VendorCard` or an `EventCard`.

The items that need to be displayed on the GUI is stored in an `ObservableList<Displayable>`, and are retrieved from the `Model` using `Model::getDisplayedList`.

### Logic Component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

The `Logic` component:

* Receives user input and parses it.
* Interacts with the `Model` component to modify the underlying data.
* Returns feedback to the user through a `CommandResult`.

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person). Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to complete execution.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the `AddressBookParser` works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser`, where `XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name (e.g `DeleteCommandParser`).
* The newly created parser parses the user command and creates a `XYZCommand` object (e.g `DeleteCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g. `DeleteCommandParser`) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component:

* Stores the address book data (i.e. all `Contact` objects inside a `UniqueContactList` and all `Event` objects inside a `UniqueEventList`).
* Stores the currently 'selected' `Contact` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate filtered list.
* Stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate filtered list.
* Stores an `ObservableList<Displayable>` to represent the objects which need to be displayed by `UI`. When either the filtered contact list or filtered event list gets updated, this list of displayed items will be updated as well.
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* Does not depend on `Ui`, `Logic` or `Storage`.

There are 2 main types of objects in Dream Day Designer: `Contact` and `Event`.

#### `Contact`

Represents a contact within the address book. `Contact` can be either:

* **`Client`**: Clients are contacts who are hosting the weddings.
* **`Vendor`**: Vendors provide services for the wedding (e.g. catering).

#### `Event`

Represents a wedding event.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component:

* Saves both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* Inherits from both `DreamDayDesignerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* Depends on `Model` since the data model of `Contact` and `Event` are defined within `Model`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.ddd.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<!-- ### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedDreamDayDesigner`. It extends `DreamDayDesigner` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `dreamDayDesignerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedDreamDayDesigner#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedDreamDayDesigner#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedDreamDayDesigner#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitDreamDayDesigner()`, `Model#undoDreamDayDesigner()` and `Model#redoDreamDayDesigner()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedDreamDayDesigner` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitDreamDayDesigner()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `dreamDayDesignerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitDreamDayDesigner()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `dreamDayDesignerStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitDreamDayDesigner()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `dreamDayDesignerStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoDreamDayDesigner()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial DreamDayDesigner state, then there are no previous DreamDayDesigner states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoDreamDayDesigner()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoDreamDayDesigner()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `dreamDayDesignerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone DreamDayDesigner states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoDreamDayDesigner()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitDreamDayDesigner()`, `Model#undoDreamDayDesigner()` or `Model#redoDreamDayDesigner()`. Thus, the `dreamDayDesignerStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitDreamDayDesigner()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `dreamDayDesignerStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is `Dream Day Designer` and the **Actor** is the `Wedding planner`, unless specified otherwise)

**Name: UC01 - Add Contact (Vendor/Client)**

**Main Success Scenario (MSS):**
1. Wedding planner selects the option to create a new contact.
2. System requests for the details of the contact (client or vendor).
3. Wedding planner enters the required details (name, phone number, etc.).
4. System validates the entered details (check for format, duplication, etc.).
5. System creates the contact and assigns a unique ID to the contact.
6. System displays a success message confirming the creation of the contact.

**Extensions:**

* 3a. System detects an error in the entered data (e.g., invalid phone number).

  * 3a1. System requests the correct data.
  * 3a2. Wedding planner enters new data.

    Use case resumes from step 4.

* 5a. The contact already exists in the system (duplicate contact).

  * 5a1. System displays a message that the contact already exists.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Compatibility: Should work on any mainstream OS (Windows/macOS/Linux) as long as Java `17` or above is installed.
2. Compatibility: The system should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.
3. User Experience: Should be able to hold up to 1000 contacts and events without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
4. User Experience: The system should respond within two seconds.
5. User Experience: A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
6. Privacy: User data must remain on the local machine and not be shared or transmitted to any external services unless explicitly requested by the user (e.g., exporting contacts).
